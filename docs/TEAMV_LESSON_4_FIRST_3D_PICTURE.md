# 📸 TEAM V: LESSON 4 - Your First 3D Picture

Welcome to Lesson 4! We've talked to the computer, now let's make it show us something. Since our Cloud Lab is a computer in the sky, we can't "see" its screen directly—but we can tell it to take a picture for us!

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL
Tell the 3D engine to take a picture of the Drow Ranger and view it in your browser.

## 🛠️ THE STEPS

### 1. The Cloud Screenshot Command
Click in your terminal and type this command:
```bash
make screenshot-cloud
```

### 2. Wait for the "Click" 📸
The engine will start up, load the Drow Ranger, wait 60 frames (about 1 second), and then save a picture.
- Wait until the terminal says: `[SCREENSHOT] Saved to screenshot_....png`

### 3. Open the Picture
1. On the left side of your screen, you will see a list of files.
2. Look for a new file that starts with `screenshot_` and ends with `.png`.
3. **Click it!**

### 4. See the Drow Ranger!
VS Code will open the picture. If you see the Drow Ranger standing in the 3D world, you have succeeded!
