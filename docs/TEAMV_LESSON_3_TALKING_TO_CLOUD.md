# 🗣️ TEAM V: LESSON 3 - Talking to the Cloud

Welcome to Lesson 3! Your Cloud Lab is open. Now, let's see if we can get it to talk to us.

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL
Ask the computer a question and get a "Hello" from our 3D engine.

## 🛠️ THE STEPS

### 1. Click the Terminal
Click inside that dark box at the bottom of your screen where you saw the `$`.

### 2. Type the Magic Command
Copy and paste this exact line into the box and press **Enter**:
```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

### 3. Watch the Magic 🧙‍♂️
The computer will start building our engine. You will see lots of lines scrolling by. This is the computer "thinking."
- **Wait about 1-2 minutes.**
- It's finished when you see a list of "Options" like `--screenshot` or `--animation`.

### 4. Read the Engine's Reply
Look at the very first line of the reply. It should say:
`3D Renderer for Dota 2 hero models with animation playback`

If you see that, you have successfully "talked" to our engine in the cloud!
