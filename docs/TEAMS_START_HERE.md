# ⚔️ TEAM S: START HERE!

Welcome Team S! This guide will help you dive into the technical side of our 3D renderer and coordinate with Team Dragon and Team V.

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Refine the 3D rendering pipeline and implement advanced technical features like shaders and high-fidelity animations.

## 🛠️ SETUP & WORKFLOW
1.  **IDE**: We use **VS Code** with the recommended extensions (Rust-analyzer, etc.).
2.  **Environment**: Native Ubuntu is preferred. See `docs/DEV_DEV_NATIVE_SETUP.md` if you are on Windows/macOS.
3.  **Commands**:
    - `make dev`: Standard development build.
    - `make guardrail`: Run before every commit.

## ✅ CURRENT PRIORITIES
- [ ] **Code Audit**: Review `src/model/accessories.rs` for performance.
- [ ] **Docs**: Help translate technical guides in `docs/fr/`.
- [ ] **Features**: Check the "Pending" section in `docs/DEV_DEV_DECISIONS.md`.

## 🤖 AI COLLABORATION
Follow the `docs/APPRENTICE_AI_GUIDE.md` for our "Plan First" protocol. Always use specific context headers when prompting.

## 📡 COORDINATION
- **Status Tracking**: Update `docs/fr/STATUS.md` weekly.
- **Communication**: Use `docs/TEAM_TEAM_COMMUNICATION.md` for cross-team sync.
