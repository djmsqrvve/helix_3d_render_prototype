# 🎨 TEAM V: LESSON 2 - The Color Alchemist

Welcome back, Team V! Now that you've signed in, it's time to change the world. Literally!

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL
Change the background color of the 3D renderer to your favorite color.

## 🛠️ THE STEPS

### 1. Find the Code
In VS Code (or GitHub), go into the `src/` folder and click on the file named `main.rs`.

### 2. Search for "COLOR"
Look for a line that looks like this:
```rust
.insert_resource(ClearColor(Color::srgb(0.1, 0.1, 0.1))) // LESSON 2: CHANGE THIS COLOR!
```
*(Hint: It's usually near the top of the file!)*

### 3. Change the Numbers
The numbers `(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)` are **Red, Green, and Blue**.
- To make it **Bright Red**, change it to `(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
- To make it **Deep Blue**, change it to `(0.0, 0.0, 0.5)`.
- To make it **Purple**, change it to `(0.5, 0.0, 0.5)`.
- To make it **White**, change it to `(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)`.
