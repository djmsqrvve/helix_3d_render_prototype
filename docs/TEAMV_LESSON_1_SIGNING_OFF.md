# ✍️ TEAM V: LESSON 1 - The Explorer's Signature

Welcome to your first mission, Team V! To build a big project, we all need to know how to "Sign In" and share our work.

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL
Add your name to the **Hall of Heroes** using just your web browser!

## 🛠️ THE STEPS (In your Browser)

### 1. Find the File
Go to the main project page on GitHub and click on the file named `HALL_OF_HEROES.md`.

### 2. Click the Pencil ✏️
On the right side of the screen, look for the **Pencil icon** (it says "Edit this file" when you hover over it). Click it!

### 3. Make Your Mark
Scroll to the bottom and add your name to the list. Use this format:
- `[Your Name] - Team V Leader - I have read the guides! 🚀`

### 4. The "Commit" (Saving to the Cloud)
Look for the green button that says **"Commit changes..."** at the top right.
1. In the first box, type: `feat: Team V Leader signing in!`
