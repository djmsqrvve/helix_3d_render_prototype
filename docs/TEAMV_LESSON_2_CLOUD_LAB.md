# ☁️ TEAM V: LESSON 2 - The Cloud Laboratory

Welcome to Lesson 2! Now that you've signed our Hall of Heroes, it's time to step into our **Cloud Laboratory**. This is a powerful computer in the sky that already has everything installed for you.

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL
Launch a "GitHub Codespace" and see your first terminal.

## 🛠️ THE STEPS

### 1. The Green Button 🟢
Go to the main page of our project on GitHub. Look for the big green button that says **"<> Code"**.

### 2. Create Codespace
1. Click the **"Codespaces"** tab in that menu.
2. Click the big button that says **"Create codespace on main"**.

### 3. The Waiting Game ⏳
A new tab will open with a dark screen. It's setting up your computer in the sky! 
- You might see a spinning circle.
- You might see some text scrolling by.
- **Wait until you see a blue bar at the bottom.**

### 4. Find the Terminal
Look at the bottom of the screen. You should see a box where you can type. That is the **Terminal**. If you see a line that ends with a `$`, you have succeeded!
