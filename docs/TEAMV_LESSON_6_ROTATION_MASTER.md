# 🔄 TEAM V: LESSON 3 - The Rotation Master

Welcome to Lesson 3, Team V! You've changed the sky, but now it's time to make the Drow Ranger move.

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL
Make the Drow Ranger spin faster or slower by changing a "Constant."

## 🛠️ THE STEPS

### 1. Find the Constants
In VS Code (or GitHub), look for the file named `src/constants.rs`.

### 2. Find the Rotation Speed
Look for the line that says:
```rust
pub const ROTATION_SPEED: f32 = 0.5;
```
*(Hint: It's at the very bottom under the APPRENTICE SECTION!)*

### 3. Change the Speed
The number `0.5` is how fast she spins.
- To make her **Super Fast**, change it to `5.0`.
- To make her **Slow and Graceful**, change it to `0.1`.
- To make her **Stop**, change it to `0.0`.

### 4. Save & Submit
1. Click **"Commit changes..."**
2. Message: `feat: Team V set rotation speed to [Your Speed]! 🔄`
3. Click **"Commit changes"**.
