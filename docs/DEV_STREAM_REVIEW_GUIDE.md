# 📺 Streamer's Guide: Reviewing & Shoutouts

This guide helps **Team Dragon** review apprentice contributions live on stream.

## 🔍 How to Check for Submissions

### 1. The "Hall of Heroes" View
The easiest way to see who signed in is to simply refresh the file:
- Go to: `https://github.com/[your-repo]/blob/main/HALL_OF_HEROES.md`
- If you see new names, they successfuly committed!

### 2. The "Commits" Feed
To see the actual "work" they did:
- Click the **"Commits"** link on the main GitHub page (next to the branch name).
- You will see a list of every person who clicked "Commit changes."
- **Stream Tip**: Click on a commit to show the chat exactly what lines that person added. It glows green!

## 📣 How to Give a "Code Review" (The Fun Way)

### 🟢 For a Perfect Mission
- **What to say**: "Big shoutout to [Name] from Team V! They just signed the Hall of Heroes. Look at that clean formatting! 🚀"
- **Action**: Go to the chat and use a "Hype" emoji.

### 🟡 If they made a mistake (e.g., deleted someone else's name)
- **What to say**: "Ooh, looks like [Name] was so excited they accidentally overwrote Team Dragon! No worries, that's what Git is for. Let's show them how to fix it."
- **Action**: Use the "Revert" button on GitHub to show them how you can "travel back in time" to fix mistakes. This is a huge learning moment!

### 🔴 If someone is being a "Griefer" (Bad names/content)
- **Action**: Click the commit -> Click "Browse files" at that point -> Use GitHub's **"Block User"** or **"Report"** if necessary.
- **Git Tip**: You can always `git reset` to a previous safe version.

## 🏆 The "Final Sign-off"
Once you are happy with the list, you can "Freeze" the lesson by updating the **Lesson Readiness Matrix** in `docs/TEAM_MATRIX.md` to say "Lesson 1: GRADUATED."
